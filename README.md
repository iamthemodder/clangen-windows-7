# ClanGen Install Helper for Windows 7 (or 8, or 10, probably 11)

I whipped this little script up to make it simpler to get ClanGen running on mainly Windows 7 machines where the installer doesn't work.

## 4 things to do:
1. Download and extract this repository (you can get the zip by clicking 'Code' followed by 'Download ZIP' above the file list, or just click [this link](https://github.com/iamthemodder/clangen-windows-7/archive/refs/heads/main.zip "Link to ZIP").
2. Download and install Python 3.8.6 and make sure to check the "Add Python 3.8 to PATH" checkbox. (you can get it from [this link](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-amd64.exe "Python Download"))
3. Download the latest ClanGen from the repository and place the zip alongside the extracted files from this repository. ([click here to download the latest version](https://github.com/Thlumyn/clangen/archive/refs/heads/development.zip "ClanGen Latest"))
4. Run "Install_ClanGen.bat" and watch the magic happen! (it's very quick so you might only get to see the results ;>)

## What will it do?
It extracts the ClanGen zip to a folder in your user's home directory, and creates a nice little shortcut to the game on your desktop! (it also cleans up the install files so you don't end up with clutter!)

Enjoy :>
